# What is Drystone?
Drystone is a tool for creating choose your own adventure stories/games on the web, it is meant to be easy to use and require
no programming knowledge to make simple choice based web games.

# Why are you making this?
I've always been fascinated with the choose your own adventure (CYOA) genre both as books and as video games. I've tried to make
text based video games in the past but it always feels super clunky and time consuming. I know there are some tools that exist
online already for crafting stories but I haven't seen anything as flexible as clicking a few buttons.

# What are your plans to develop Drystone further?
At the moment the focus is on getting the basics implemented, that means the ability to create choice based stories from 
start to finish; The ability add some basic formatting to your pages and some of the underlying basics like saving the game
and being able to load a previous save.

Beyond this the hope is to develop a module system whereby you can choose to add features to your story/game as you see fit.
Maybe you have a need for player stats, an inventory system, music or even custom game logic.

# Is there anything I can do to help?
The main way you can help out is by using the tool, submitting any bug reports and providing feedback and suggestions on how
I can tweak features.

If you fancy getting involved on the programming side of things, it would certainly be appreciated, feel free to get in touch
or open a pull request on some of the issues on GitHub.
